The inagural post. Well, hello all you out there.

My name is Rhett. I program for a public ubiversity where I make whatever they want using mostly what technilogies I feel will be most benificial to the project. I get to mentor others. I get to experiment. I have a great job.


## How I got here

I started progamming in middle school with qBasic, to this day I still misspell goto. I really got into it in high school with Java and tutored others through senior year and what college I took. 

I hated aspects of my school and was doing well selling component level electronics, cables, and security equipment so I decided to focus on that for a while instead until I became buyer and manager of the store. I was a great place to work for a time, but I found in the end I hated every second of it. so I needed a change. 


## I remembered my love

I needed to get back to programming -- I had no doubt of this. 

I tried Java again, didn't like the verbosity; a lot of work for little outcome -- at least that's how I saw it at the time. ALso, I wanted to write in something that was more directly linked to a visual component, so I played with actionscript v3. AS3 was great, until it died only months after I got into it. 

Somehow I picked up PHP, I think it was because AS3 couldn't get **outside** information except for through PHP and XML (and I know I dislike XML). I really owe a lot to [PHP 101][1] which has apearently changed websites and authors a couple times since I read it.

After I completed all of PHP 101, for six months straight, if I wasn't working or sleeping I was programming -- often programming during those too. I programmed a site for creating multiple versions of tests. My girlfriend was a teacher and she spent eight or more hours rearanging questions and answers to create multiple versions of a test to prevent cheating and I wanted a safe secure way she could do so instantly and produce a key, so I could spend more time with her. 


## My new life

I found someone who would trust me, at least enough to let me try. The job was far away. The pay was just over half of what I was acustomed. I got to program professionally!

I worked hard and continued my education evey day. I moved up to one of the two lead developers, small company but  still proud of my accomplishment. I was lead programmer, in charge of new development, and I re-wrote or streamlined eighty percent of their PHP 4.x/5.1 legacy code to modern standars for PHP 5.3. 


## Stepping up

We lost our javascript person at one point and we needed frontend development, something which I knew nothing about, but it was a great oportunity to learn something new.

I, like many at the time, had a deep mistrust of JavaScript -- starting with Java years before and the horrible atmosphere javascript endured back then, who could blame me -- but found jQuery made it useable and even fun.

I started like most creating scripts, then modules, then making magic! I eventually started up in the Angular community with 1.0.x and began attending and giving presentations in the community. I realized that jQuery was the first love that was, however unfortunately, holding me back on one level or another. 


## Node and Beyond

I moved where I am now to be closer to friends and family and greatly enjoy what I do.

I got the chance to pick up Node.js as my new platform of choice and I haven't regretted it a day since.


## TL; DR
 
Long way to get here, with planty of bumps, but I love where I am and I love where I am going. I'm glad Node.js is here and love programming with it every moment. Best of all, this is just the beginning!
